# Introduction #

MiniBuilder uses the standard Adobe Flex SDK to build ActionScript and Flex projects.<br>
Therefore, MiniBuilder benefits all the features offered by the SDK.<br>
<br>
In order to connect to Flex SDK, which is a Java program, MiniBuilder, which is a Flash application, uses JetMBCompiler a Java communication layer between ActionScript and the SDK. You can't use MiniBuilder without JetMBCompiler.<br>
